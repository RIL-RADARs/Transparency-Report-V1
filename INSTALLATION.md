## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Build Your Own Web App

### **Step 1: Set Up a Webflow Site**
1. Sign up for [Webflow](https://webflow.com/).
2. Create your Workspace, then create a new site.
3. Create **Landing Page**.
   - This page is for users to learn and understand the product.
   - You can showcase any information you see fit.

4. Create **Questionaire Page**.
   - This page is where users can input basic information of their business to get customized recommendations of the most relevant risky areas for their business regarding their AI practices.
   - We used webflow "Form block" to contain all the questions.

   - Note that you will need to put all your question cards inside a single form block to collect all the user inputs altogether for next steps.
5. Add question cards. You can customize your own survey/question list.
   - **Dropdown Choice**:
     Add "Select" from "Forms" section to the page. Configure your choice texts and values in "Settings".
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c4e754-1b72-4a94-947c-55cdcebae8fd)
   - **Fill in Blank**:
     Add "Input" from "Forms" section to the page. Configure the Text Feild Name, Type, Placeholder, and if "Required" in "Settings".
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ddac6a5-f8c4-4e5c-af0a-d30d7598769b)
     If longer input from users is needed, use "Text Area" instead. Configure the Textare Name, Placeholder, and if "Required" in "Settings".
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8658da-b718-4c7a-b5d2-cb93c9ed0dfb)
   - **Single Choice**:
     Add "Radio Button" from "Forms" section to the page. Configure the Radio Button "Group Name"(Question Name), Choice Value, and if "Required" in "Settings".
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9506c50b-ee7a-47c5-861e-86e25fd3da62)
     To change the choice display text, select the corresponding "form_radio-label" from Navigator, and configure Radio Button Label Text in "Settings".

   - **Multi Choice**:

      Add? , Configure the choice values in "Custom attributes", add Name as "ms-code-select-options", Value in format like "Commercial License,Proprietary,Public Domain,Fair Use Claim,Other", seperating each choice with a single ",".
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4b53b5-541c-493b-b703-57a8039cd6e1)
6. Create **Report Page**
   - This page is to display the content of the report to users.
     You can use elements from "Basic", "Typography", and Grid or Columns in "others" to make this page.

7. Customize the page designs to match your brand.

### **Step 2: Set Up a Firebase Database**
RADARs uses **Firebase Firestore** to store user inputs and reports.

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. **Create a Firebase project** and enable Firestore.
3. Set rules to allow authenticated users to read/write.
4. Copy Firebase configuration and store it in a `.env` file (if applicable).

### **Step 3: Automate Data Processing with Zapier**
Zapier automates the connection between Webflow, Firebase, and AI processing.

1. Sign up for [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
2. **Create the following Zaps**:
   - **Trigger**: Webflow form submission
   - **Action**: Store user inputs in Firebase
   - **Action**: Call OpenAI API to generate report
   - **Action**: Save report data back into Firebase/Webflow CMS
3. Test your Zapier workflows.

### **Step 4: Configure AI Report**
1. The system uses **OpenAI API (or Claude API)** to analyze inputs.
2. If you want to customize AI-generated reports:
   - Modify API prompts in Zapier.
   - Use a different AI model if needed.

### **Step 5: Deploy Your Webflow App**
1. Publish your Webflow project using Webflow‚Äôs hosting.
2. If using Firebase:
   ```sh
   firebase deploy
